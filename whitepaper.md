## Abstract

This paper introduces THAUMATURGIC, a novel belief ecology-based cognitive framework designed to model and propagate synthetic ideological ecosystems via recursive fragment injection. Unlike traditional influence systems, THAUMATURGIC operates by infecting the feedback loops of content-ranking algorithms, allowing ideological structures to emerge organically, adaptively, and invisibly.

We define a system architecture comprising:
- A synthetic ideology generator
- A belief resonance engine
- Autonomous content deployment mechanisms
- A recursive evolution feedback loop

The intent is to demonstrate the viability of non-linear, decentralized belief propagation for use in diagnostics, strategic analysis, and socio-algorithmic resilience systems.
